**@wq/material** provides unified vocabulary of Material Design components for the React web environment as well as React Native / Expo.
@wq/material provides a consistent API in both environments, reducing the need for project-specific ".native.js" implementations.

The actual bindings for each environment are provided by [@wq/material-web] and [@wq/material-native], either or both of which should be installed in addition to @wq/material.
